- enums

- value/ref types

- string is ref type that behaves like value type

- strings are immutable which is why string.trim() does not overwrite the original
you've gotta do string = string.trim(), its returning a new string

- array is ref type, arrays have fixed size

- 'solutions' house multiple projects

- assemblies are what the compiler makes

- in addition to public/private, also internal (within project)

- method overloading - 2 methods can has the same name if they take args of different types

- return type NOT part of 'method signature'

- constructors can also be overloaded

- a constructor can call another constructor from its class like
: this("parameter")

- properties have 'get' and 'set' accessors

- field vs property?

- auto implemented prop has get; set;

- 'subscribers' listen to events
