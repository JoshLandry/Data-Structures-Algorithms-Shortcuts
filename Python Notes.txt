whitespace / indentation are important in Python - 4 spaces

Methods that use dot notation only work with strings.

When we pass a list to a function and modify that list, like in the double_first function above, we end up modifying the original list.

'Not' is evaluated before 'and' and 'or'

While True: is a ridiculous way to do a 'Do while'

Else conditions on while and for loops only execute if the loop 'ends normally', as in there is no 'break' statement.

if you don't capitalize 'true' and 'false' it won't know wtf you mean
